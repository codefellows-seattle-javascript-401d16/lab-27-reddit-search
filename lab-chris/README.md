## Description
401 JS -- lab 27

Started out with Duncan's code. Quickly realized I would rather start from scratch so I basically erased almost everything and started again. Got up to the part where I made a get request and was getting an error message in the terminal about a cors request. Found out that the link that was in the repo didn't have www in it causing my issue. Got my object back. Eventually parsed it to the info I needed. Worked on getting everything on the page for far too long. Completed the lab.
